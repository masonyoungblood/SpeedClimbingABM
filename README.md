Data and code associated with ["Simulation-based inference with deep learning suggests speed climbers combine innovation and copying to improve performance"](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/n3rvk)---a preprint on PsyArXiv.

This agent-based model simulates a dynamic population of professional speed climbers, and incorporates parameters for athletic improvement, innovation of “beta” (or route sequence), and copying of other climbers’ beta. Here are the locations of various files in the repository:

- Climbing times used for simulation: `climbing_times/best_climbing_times.RData`
- Manually-transcribed climbing sequences from IFSC World Championships: `climbing_times/ifsc_world_championship`
- Full simulation-based inference pipeline: `analysis`

Files over 100 MB are ignored to avoid GitHub limit problems.
