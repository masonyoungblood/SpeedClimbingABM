        Data and code associated with the manuscript Simulation-based inference with deep learning suggests speed climbers combine innovation and copying to improve performance, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B (https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2025.1433).

        This agent-based model simulates a dynamic population of professional speed climbers, and incorporates parameters for athletic improvement, innovation of “beta” (or route sequence), and copying of other climbers beta. Here are the locations of various files in the repository:

        - climbing_times/all_climbing_times.RData: all climbing times for all competitors in each year.
        - climbing_times/best_climbing_times.RData: best climbing time for each competitor in each year (used for simulation).
        - climbing_times/ifsc_world_championship and climbing_times/ifsc_world_championship.numbers: manually-transcribed climbing sequences from IFSC events.
        - climbing_times/lfigil_ifsc_data and lfigil_processing.R: climbing times from IFSC events (collected by lfigil, https://github.com/lfigil/ifsc-data) and a processing script to convert them to the RData files.
        - analysis: full simulation-based inference pipeline.
        - SpeedClimbingABM.R: source code for the agent-based model.
        - grid.csv and speed_wall.png: coordinates and visualization of each hold on the route.
