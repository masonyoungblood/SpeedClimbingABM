This agent-based model simulates a dynamic population of professional speed climbers, and incorporates parameters for athletic improvement, innovation of "beta" (or route sequence), and copying of other climbers' beta.

## Athletic Improvement

Athletic improvement is simulated using a bounded exponential function controlled by three parameters: `rate_m`, `rate_sd`, and `min`. `rate_m` controls the mean exponential rate across all climbers, `rate_sd` controls the standard deviation of the exponential rate to introduce variation in ability, and `min` controls the asymptotic lower bound. The result of this function is an `athletic_improvement` index for each climber over time (x-axis). Below is an example with a `rate_m` of 2, a `rate_sd` of 0.2, and a `min` of 0.4.

```{r}
#bounded exponential function
bounded_exp <- function(x, rate, min){
  return((1-min)*(rate/rate^x)+min)
}

#generate values
x <- 1:12
rates <- truncnorm::rtruncnorm(100, a = 1, mean = 2, sd = 0.2)
y <- sapply(1:length(rates), function(h){bounded_exp(x, rates[h], 0.4)})

#plot
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
matplot(x, y, type = "l", xlab = "Timestep", ylab = "Athletic Improvement", ylim = c(0, 1), col = scales::alpha("black", 0.2), lty = 1)
```

In each timestep, a climbers current record comes from multiplying the time per handhold by this `athletic_improvement` index.

## Beta & Reference Times

Now, how do we use these distributions in combination with hold sequences? First, let's look at a diagram of the standardized speed wall.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.kindpng.com/picc/m/592-5929143_speed-climbing-wall-sketch-speed-climbing-route-map.png")
```

As you can see, the standardized speed wall has a total of 20 hand holds and 11 foot holds. Speed climbers often "smear" their feet on the wall or use hand holds for feet, so we will only be modeling the time spent on hand holds. Each climber will be initialized with a vector of their beta, or a TRUE/FALSE for whether they use each hand hold in the route, along with a vector of sequence ratios. The sequence ratios will be drawn from a truncated normal distribution with a lower bound at 0, a mean of 1, and a standard deviation parameter that controls the initial variation in times across holds. The actual amount of time spent on each hold, then, will be these sequence ratios multiplied by an initial climbing time (let's say 18 seconds) divided by the number of holds. For now the beta vectors will start out as all TRUE, so that all climbers start out using every hold in the route. Here is an example of how the beta and sequence ratio vectors are initialized.

```{r}
#set number of holds
n_holds <- 20

#set initial mean speed
init_time <- 18

#set probability of initial beta holds at 1 (all holds on the route)
beta_true_prob <- 1

#set parameter controlling the SD of sequence ratios
sd_multiplier <- 0.5

#initialize starting beta
beta <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), n_holds, prob = c(beta_true_prob, 1-beta_true_prob), replace = TRUE)

#initialize sequence ratios
seq_ratios <- truncnorm::rtruncnorm(n_holds, a = 0, mean = 1, sd = sd_multiplier)

#print the beta and climbing time vectors
beta
(init_time/n_holds)*seq_ratios
```

This `sd_multiplier` value of 0.5 generates a distribution of times per hold that is similar to the example distribution in [Reveret et al. (2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02188/full) (see below), and is close to the variation in times per hold observed in lead climbing [(Seifert et al., 2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14763141.2020.1830161). A more recent study that estimated times per hold for two high-level climbers in the 2019 IFSC World Cup suggests that an `sd_multiplier` value of 0.33 may be more appropriate [(Pandurevic et al., 2022)](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/6/2251), but in exploratory analyses the posterior for this parameter converged to 0.5. We will make a simplifying assumption and use 0.5 for all of our simulations.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=0.4}
#get cumulative climbing times
cum_num <- cumsum(c(0, (init_time/n_holds)*seq_ratios))

#restructure and plot
to_plot <- data.frame(x = unlist(sapply(1:(length(cum_num)-1), function(x){seq(cum_num[x], cum_num[x+1], by = 0.01)})),
                      y = unlist(sapply(1:(length(cum_num)-1), function(x){rep(x, length(seq(cum_num[x], cum_num[x+1], by = 0.01)))})))
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
plot(to_plot$x, to_plot$y, type = "l", xlab = "Time (s)", ylab = "Hold #")
```

In each timestep, each climber has a certain `innov_prob` probability of innovation. Innovations are changes to the beta of the route, in this case flipping one of the booleans of the `beta` vector from TRUE to FALSE (or vice versa). Not all boolean flips are possible. The parameter `adj_poss` controls the number of successive FALSE booleans that are allowed in the model (to simulate the fact that skipping three holds in a row and still being able to complete the route is *extremely* unlikely). When a boolean flip occurs (i.e. when a hold is added to or dropped from the beta) the `seq_ratios` of the adjacent holds are resampled (based on the mean initial climbing times of the population), since the amount of time spent on the adjacent holds is dependent on the presence of the added/dropped hold. When each climber innovates, they compare the overall route time for their current beta with the innovated beta, and if the innovated beta is better then they overwrite their current beta. See `SpeedClimbingABM.R` for details.

## Social Learning

In each timestep, each climber also has a certain `learn_prob` probability of copying the beta of another climber. When a climber copies another climber, they only have access to the top `n_top` fastest climbers in the current timestep. They "try out" all of the betas of the fastest climbers that are different from their own beta, and if one of them yields a faster time then they overwrite their current `beta` and `seq_ratios` with those of better beta. See `SpeedClimbingABM.R` for details.

## Dynamic Population Size

We also allow the population size to grow over time. For now we just have a dynamic population size of `n` climbers and the probability `leave_prob` of leaving the sport in each timestep. Basically, at the end of each timestep a random subset of climbers leave the sport, and new climbers enter the sport to bring the population up to the size specified by `n`. The probability of a climber leaving the sport is a function of how far their current record is from the current best among climbers of the same gender as well as how long they've been in the sport, so older climbers with slower times are more likely to leave. Specifically it is their `current_record` divided by the minimum `current_record` in the population multiplied by `age`, or the number of timesteps that they have been in the sport. Each new climber that enters the sport inherits information from two randomly sampled climbers from that timestep: `seq_ratios` and `beta` come from one, and `dist` comes from another. See `SpeedClimbingABM.R` for details.

## Interaction Effects

For our study, we want to add some interaction effects between innovation, social learning, ranking, and population size. More specifically, we want to innovation and social learning change with climbers' current rankings and with population size. To do this, we will adjust the mean innovation and social learning rates of the population with the following two equations for innovation and social learning, respectively:

$$\mu = \mu_{avg} + (\mu_{avg} * t_{norm} * {\phi}) + (\mu_{avg} * p_{norm} * {\omega})$$

$$\lambda = \lambda_{avg} + (\lambda_{avg} * t_{norm} * {\epsilon}) + (\lambda_{avg} * p_{norm} * {\sigma})$$

In each case there are three parameters in play. For innovation ($\mu$) there is the population average ($\mu_{avg}$), the effect of a climber's record time ($\phi$), and the effect of population size ($\omega$). The effects of time and population size are computed as follows: (1) all values are collected and normalize to be between -0.5 and 0.5 (to prevent $\mu$ from taking a value that is negative or greater than 1), (2) the normalized values are multiplied by number between -1 and 1, where the sign and absolute value control the direction and strength of the effect, respectively, and (3) the values are the multiplied by the innovation rate. Social learning is computed identically.

## Test Run

The ABM functions are in the `SpeedClimbingABM.R` file. Please refer to the functions in this file for details.

```{r}
source("SpeedClimbingABM.R")
```

Let's do a test run of this model based on the observed data from the women in the population.

```{r}
load("data.RData")
data <- data[which(data$gender == "W"), ]
```

First we need the observed population sizes, leave probabilities, and initial climbing times.

```{r}
#get years
years <- sort(unique(data$year))

#population sizes
n <- unlist(lapply(1:length(years), function(x){nrow(data[which(data$year == years[x]), ])}))

#leave probabilities
leave_prob <- unlist(lapply(1:(length(years)-1), function(x){
  temp_a <- data[which(data$year == years[x]), ]
  temp_b <- data[which(data$year == years[x+1]), ]
  length(which(!(temp_a$athlete %in% temp_b$athlete)))/nrow(temp_a)
}))

#initial climbing times
init_times <- data[which(data$year == years[1]), ]$time
```

Now let's run the model with an initial population size of `r n[1]`, a 0.2 probability of learning from the top 20 climbers, and a 0.2 probability of innovation where no more than 2 adjacent holds can be skipped. The `improve_rate_m` of athletic improvement will be 2, the `improve_rate_sd` will be 0.2, and the `min` improvement possible will be 0.4. `bw` and `ylim`, control the density bandwidth and y-axis limit in the plot, respectively. `sum_stats` controls whether summary statistics are calculated from the output, `plot` controls whether the output is plotted, and `bw` and `ylim` control the density bandwidth and y-axis limit of the plot, respectively.

```{r, fig.asp=0.6}
#set seed
set.seed(1234)

#store starting time
start <- Sys.time()

#run model
output <- SpeedClimbingABM(n = n, leave_prob = leave_prob, init_times = init_times,
                           n_holds = 20, beta_true_prob = 1, learn_prob = 0.2, n_top = 20,
                           innov_prob = 0.2, adj_poss = 2, improve_rate_m = 2, improve_rate_sd = 0.2, improve_min = 0.4,
                           sum_stats = TRUE, plot = TRUE, bw = 0.6, ylim = 0.4)

#print run time
Sys.time() - start
```

In the above plot, each distribution (from right to left) is the distribution of `current_records` for climbers in the population in each timestep. The output of this ABM a table of the summary statistics (quantiles) from each timestep.

```{r}
output
```

Let's do another run of the model, but let's add interaction effects so that climbers with slower times are more likely to learn (`learn_x_times` = 1), climbers with faster times are more likely to innovate (`innov_x_times` = -1), and both learning and innovation become more common as population size increases (`learn_x_pop` and `innov_x_pop` = 1).

```{r, fig.asp=0.6}
#set seed
set.seed(123)

#store starting time
start <- Sys.time()

#run model
output <- SpeedClimbingABM(n = n, leave_prob = leave_prob, init_times = init_times,
                           n_holds = 20, beta_true_prob = 1, learn_prob = 0.2, n_top = 20,
                           innov_prob = 0.2, adj_poss = 2, improve_rate_m = 2, improve_rate_sd = 0.2, improve_min = 0.4,
                           learn_x_times = 1, innov_x_times = -1, learn_x_pop = 1, innov_x_pop = 1,
                           sum_stats = TRUE, plot = TRUE, bw = 0.6, ylim = 0.4)

#print run time
Sys.time() - start
```
